This significant, albeit not dominant, frequency highlights a strategic opportunity for product development: by incorporating accessible, pick-up-and-play mechanics, or by framing a game with casual undertones, developers can effectively broaden their game's appeal. This approach can lower the barrier to entry, attract a wider audience beyond traditional core gamers, and potentially enhance user acquisition, retention, and monetization through increased session frequency and accessibility. It suggests that while a game's primary genre might be distinct, infusing it with casual design principles is a leading differentiator for market success.",
